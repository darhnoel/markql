# Case Studies

Practical, end-to-end extraction walk-throughs for developers in the field.

- [Field Hunting Playbook](field-hunting-playbook.md)

Use these when:

- you have unknown HTML and need a reliable extraction query fast
- your first query returns empty or noisy rows
- you want a repeatable debugging flow instead of trial-and-error

Case-study assets live under this directory:

- `docs/case-studies/fixtures/` for HTML snapshots
- `docs/case-studies/queries/` for runnable MarkQL queries
