# MarkQL Book Draft (Legacy Entry)

The chapter-based, verified book now lives in `docs/book/`.

- Start here: [docs/book/SUMMARY.md](book/SUMMARY.md)
- Verify all documented commands: `./docs/verify_examples.sh`
- Semantic deep dive (canonical scope model): [markql-deep-dive.md](markql-deep-dive.md)

## Why this file still exists
This file is kept as a stable pointer for older links and branch history.
All new long-form teaching content is maintained in the `docs/book/` chapter set.
